    <p>I was going to use this failed experiment for post titles, but it just looked ugly.</p>
    <p>I used <a href="https://github.com/mattdesl/svg-mesh-3d" target="_blank">svg-mesh-3d</a> to produce a simplicial complex vector array of the mesh, then converted the output to use cartesian coordinates. D3 handles the rest of the animation magic.</p>
    <p>Yes, the font is comic sans :/</p>
