        <a href="http://www.x3dom.org/" target="_blank">x3dom</a> is a declarative specification for creating 3D web graphics. It's very much a 3D analog of SVG in this way, and makes creating 3D gfx much easier. For example, creating a cubiod is a case of adding a <span class="element">box</span> element to the DOM.

        Because of this, D3 can support manipulating x3d elements out of the box just as easily as you would edit SVG or HTML. The example to the left can be manipulated with your mouse.

        I've also found that not much code is required to produce things.
