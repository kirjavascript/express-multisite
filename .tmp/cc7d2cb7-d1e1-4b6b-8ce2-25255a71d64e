<FONT size=3>Attn: My Dear,</FONT></DIV>

<FONT size=3>I am Mrs. Cami Haas, I am a US citizen, 51 years Old. I reside here in Fountain Hills Arizona. My residential address is as follows. 17370 E San Marcus Dr Fountain Hills, AZ 85268, USA, am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Africa many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over US$46,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>So I decided to travel down to Washington, D.C. with all my compensation documents, And I was directed to meet Lawyer John Smith, who is the member of UN COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $10,500,000.00 Moreover, Lawyer John Smith, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email address as one of the beneficiaries, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Lawyer John Smith.</FONT></DIV>
